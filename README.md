# CyberVault: Password Manager
> By Tyler Higgins
---

# First Run:
The first run of this program need to be done as an administrator, this is due to the fact that a secure key is created 
and saved in a location that only admins have access to. The program will ask to elevate to an admin if you are not one, create the key then close. This is normal. Just rerun the application and it will function normally.

Once the first run has been completed this program will run without admin rights.
